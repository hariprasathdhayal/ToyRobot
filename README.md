The Size of the Robot should be taken into consideration as there is a possibility of falling down due to gravity when it moves towards the edges.

Currently requirement says of 5X5 units we can get that as input for anysize.

We can add a command called current postion for the user to identify where robot is currently placed.

currently as per requirement the robot looks like moving in two dimension.If robot is flying pod we can try to add one more dimension Z which is height.

we can add feature for user to provide input of the destination and robot itself finds the shortest path using algorithm.
